    "This short novel, already a modern classic, is the superbly told, tragic story of a Cuban fisherman in the Gulf Stream and the giant Marlin he kills and loses â€” specifically referred to in the citation accompanying the author's Nobel Prize for literature in 1954.",

    'To go by this debut, which was written well before she turned 18 last week, Laura Marling\'s "adolescence" was essentially a protracted period of soaking up Joni Mitchell and Bonnie "Prince" Billy. The unnervingly grown-up Alas I Cannot Swim is the result, and if it doesn\'t install her as the heir to the likes of Devendra Banhart, there\'s no hope for folk-pop.',
